# static_node_and_express_site-v1
My first backend orientated project working with Node.js and Express;

Css Styling:

I added icons for linkedin, github, twitter to the side bar in layout.pug and gave them anchor tags to direct them to my accounts on each platform, I also changed the colours of the twitter, linkedIn, and github a tags in the /about route. I also changed the live link and github repo link a tags in the /projects route to different colours. I also changed the colour of the header based on if the error or not found pug templates are active, if they are active then the header div of the document will change to red further indicating to the users that the page / route they are on is a error page (for better accessibility) this addition can be found in the error.pug and not found.pug templates.
